*DESCRIPTION*: For this task, I designed the front-end of an e-learning platform called Campus learn, specially made for college students. The website includes multiple sections like Home, Courses, Course Details, Progress Tracking, and Videos. Each section is organized in a neat and attractive layout with modern fonts, stylish backgrounds, and smooth user interface effects. I added a navigation bar, search bar, course cards, and progress bars to show course completion. The Course Detail page includes information about a selected course, along with an option to enroll. I also embedded videos in a clean, responsive layout to make learning more interactive. The design focuses on simplicity, user-friendliness, and a professional look that makes learning engaging and accessible.
